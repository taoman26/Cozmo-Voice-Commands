# Cozmo voice Commands (CvC) - Version 0.6.8

Issue multiple voice commands to [Cozmo](https://anki.com/en-us/cozmo), and watch him execute all of them sequentially: highly customizable, you can add new commands with ease. Recognizes *English, Italian, French, Dutch* but it's very easy to add new languages!

### Description
You can say _"Cozmo, **forward** 20 THEN **right** 90"_, or _"Hello Cozmo, my little friend, could you please drive forward for 3 seconds **THEN** rotate left 90 degrees **THEN** dance **THEN** drive back to your charger?"_, **and Cozmo will execute the commands in both cases**: the application will always dynamically match the recognized spoken words with the code methods and arguments, **it even parses verbs in their different conjugations**, and numbers as arguments of the action to perform.  

**Tested on macOS, Windows and Linux**

### Two steps installation
Assuming that you've already performed the [**Cozmo SDK Setup**](http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/), specific for your platform:  

1. **CvC** requires `portaudio`:

  * on **MacOS** (see [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/index_it.html) if you don't know what `brew` is):  
`brew install portaudio`

  * on **Linux**:  
`sudo apt-get install flac portaudio19-dev python-all-dev python3-all-dev libjpeg-dev && pip3 install --user PyAudio`

  * on **Windows**:  
you only need to [install git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) as it is not included by default.  

2. install `cvc` package:  
`pip3 install --upgrade git+https://github.com/taoman26/Cozmo-Voice-Commands`  
  * If you are having permission issues (happens mainly on Linux) try:  
  `pip3 install --upgrade --user git+https://github.com/taoman26/Cozmo-Voice-Commands`

**note:** to update **CvC**, repeat step **2**.

### Usage
* run command `cvc` from the Terminal application.
  * Optional arguments:  
`--version[-V]`: print version and exit  
`--no-wait[-N]`: enable deprecated continuous listening mode  
`--log[-L]`: enable verbose logging  
* choose speech recognition language and press enter.
* press **SHIFT** when you are ready, then issue your commands by voice (you have 5 seconds to start talking before it Timeouts), not too far from your PC, taking care to include the words "**Cozmo**" or "**Robot**" before any command you'll say: _"Ok COZMO, my friend, would you enjoy DANCING?"_  
**You can issue multiple commands at once:** use the word *"THEN"* (_"POI"_ in Italian, _"ALORS"_ in French, _"DAARNA"_ in Dutch, and so on...), to separate them. Right now these commands will be executed in a sequence. I plan to make some of them to be executed in parallel in the near future.
* **A list of supported commands and arguments is provided at runtime.**

### Customization
From version 0.6 you can now add new languages and commands with ease: inside `cvc/languages` folder you'll find one .json file for each language (i.e. `en.json`). To add a new command just duplicate one of the existing commands inside the .json, changing its parameters with the desired ones (_be careful to keep the same structure_):  

* **DO NOT FORGET** to change the id number, that decides language order (it's the first parameter).
* `'action'` is the name of the method/function you are going to create in `voice_commands.py`
* `'words'` are the recognized words  
* `'usage'` is a description/usage of your command  

then open `voice_commands.py` and create the new method/function for your command, just copying an existing one, taking care to use the same name you set in the `'action'` parameter, inside the .json.  
**You can even add new words to existing commands**, only be careful to not use the same words in different commands.  
To add a new language, duplicate one of the included .json language files, using the same naming, and **translate its contents**.
Your new language will be automatically loaded on startup, and a new language menu item automatically generated ;)

#### Note for Developers:
If you want to just run the App **without installing the package**, you need to execute `./cvc.py` from the root folder, after you have cloned/downloaded the [repository](https://github.com/rizal72/Cozmo-Voice-Commands) content.

### Todo next
* Allow more commands at once, to be executed in parallel, using the word _"and"_.   

**Please note:** Cozmo does not have built-in microphone, so you should talk with your computer ;)

### 日本語対応
日本語用にjanomeで形態素解析してコマンドを認識するようにしました。
ウェイクワードは「コズモ」もしくは「ロボット」です。
音声コマンドの間に「それから」と発声することで、一度に複数コマンドを実行できます。
